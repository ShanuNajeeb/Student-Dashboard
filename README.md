## Development Process

Initially, the dashboard was created with just an orange color theme. Over time, new themes were developed, each in separate files. Eventually, these themes were integrated into one dynamic interface, allowing theme switching without separate HTML files.

One of the significant challenges encountered was integrating the AI Summarizer tool directly into the dashboard. After facing difficulties in getting the direct output from the summarizer within the dashboard, a practical workaround was implemented by redirecting users to the Blackbox AI summarizer page externally.

Throughout development, most of the coding was facilitated using AI tools such as Blackbox AI, ChatGPT, and Gemini, which significantly accelerated the workflow and provided insights into advanced features and functionalities.

## Project Motivation

This project was driven purely by curiosity, learning new technologies, and exploring web development techniques. It allowed hands-on experience in integrating AI tools and designing visually appealing user interfaces.

## Possible Enhancements

* Mobile App version using React Native or Flutter.
* Integration of user accounts and data persistence.
* Expanded AI functionalities (e.g., direct summarizer integration).
